Please complete the following exercise this week. 
Write a Python script containing a function called factorial() 
that takes a single input/argument which is a positive integer 
and returns its factorial. 
The factorial of a number is that number multiplied by all of the positive numbers less than it. 
For example, the factorial of 5 is 5x4x3x2x1 which equals 120. 
You should, in your script, test the function by calling it with the values 5, 7, and 10.
